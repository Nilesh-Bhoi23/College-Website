          A Pioneer in the field of Socio-Economic and Educational
          transformation of North-West Maharashtra through the Co-operative
          Movement P. S. G. V. P. Mandal’s SIP Arts, GBP Science, and STKV Sangh
          Commerce College were established in the year 1970 by Honorable
          Sahakar Maharshi Shri. Annasaheb P. K. Patil with the objective to
          educate, motivate and uplift the vocational skills of the young
          generation of peasants and landless workers. The college has a
          progressive management team led by Shri. Bapusaheb Dipakbhai Patil,
          President, PSGVPM, Shahada. It is a multi-faculty, co-educational, and
          Government aided institution affiliated with Kavayitri Bahinabai
          Chaudhari North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon. The college has a
          glorious past with recognitions from different educational agencies.
          UGC, New Delhi has awarded us the status of ‘College with Potential
          for Excellence‘ and NAAC, Bangalore has conferred an ‘A’ grade in the
          3rd cycle. Recently our institution has been identified as a RUSA
          beneficiary college and sanctioned with Rs 2.00 crores under Component
          9- Infrastructure Grants for Colleges. To add to our pride, our
          institution is honored as DBT STAR College by the Department of
          Biotechnology, Government of India with grants of Rs. 1.04 crores. In
          the Academic Audit performed by the affiliating university, our
          college has secured ‘A’ Grade continuously for the last 5 years. With
          the help of all these agencies, we will be able to bring about
          positive changes in teaching by making it more student-centric,
          outcome-based, and research-oriented. The College provides
          instructions in various undergraduate and post-graduate courses in the
          faculties of Arts, Science and Commerce. The college began with few
          students. Today 2500+ students are registered for various UG and PG
          courses in all three faculties. The teaching faculty consists of 49
          learned faculty members and experts in their own subject discharging
          their duties with a sense of dedication and devotion. The college has
          15 departments of which 13 are postgraduate departments with 11 of
          them conducting Ph.D. programs. It has always encouraged an admission
          policy that favors students irrespective of their economic
          backgrounds. The college inculcates values that prepare a student for
          academic excellence through the paths of critical thinking, a
          professional work ethic, and the determination to be accountable.
